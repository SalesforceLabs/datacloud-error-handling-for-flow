# Installation
Available on the AppExchange as an unmanaged package installation, or manually deploy the repository from Github.

# Package Information

This package has been created to provide a basic setup for notifying an organisation’s Data Cloud admin users of failures that may occur with the Data Cloud platform in relation to the following configuration:

* Data Streams
* Data Transforms
* Calculated Insights
* Segments
* Activations
* Identity Resolution Rules

For each of the above configuration types (“metadata”), a flow has been created to manage the failures. Using Custom Metadata, you can control the behaviour of any error notifications.
